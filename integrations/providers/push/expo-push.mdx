description: "Learn how to use the Expo push provider to send push notifications using Novu"
---

## Getting Started
[Expo Push](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/) is a notification delivery service provided by Expo.

To enable Expo Push integration, you need to create an [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/)account and generate an access token in the EAS dashboard.

The overrides field supports all [Message Request](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#message-request-format) values. An example of the same follows:

```jsx
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "<SUBSCRIBER_ID>",
  },
  payload: {
    abc: "def",
  },
});
```

Before triggering the notification to a subscriber(user) with push as a step in the workflow, make sure you have added the subscriber's device token as follows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javaScript
import {
  Novu,
  PushProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', PushProviderIdEnum.EXPO, {
  deviceTokens: ['token1', 'token2'],
});

````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "expo",
  "deviceTokens": ["token1", "token2"]
}'
````

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Checkout the [API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) for more details.


## Expo Provider Overrides

Novu allows you to leverage all of the custom SDK parameters that Expo SDK provides. Here is the full list of supported overrides.

```typescript
await step.push('push-step', () => {
  return {
    body: 'Email body'
  }
}, {
  providers: {
    expo: ({ controls }) => {
      return {
        notification: {
          subtitle: 'Hello World',
          critical: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

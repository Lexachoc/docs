import { MissingProvider } from "/snippets/missing-provider.mdx";

Novu can be used to deliver email messages to your customers using a unified delivery API. You can easily integrate your favorite email provider using the built-in integration store.

## Configuring email providers

When creating an email provider integration you will be asked to provide additional fields alongside the provider-specific credentials:

- **Sender name** - Will be displayed as the sender of the message
- **From email address** - Emails sent using Novu will be sent using this address

For some email providers including SendGrid you will have to authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you will send email messages using an authorized address.

## Email Provider Overrides

Novu allows to override the provider specific SDK configuration. This is helpful when you want to utilize a provider specific feature that is not available on the generic email step interface.

The full definition of the supported provider overrides can be found in the provider pages.

```typescript
await step.email('email-step', () => {
  return {
    subject: 'Hello World',
    body: 'Email body'
  }
}, {
  providers: {
    sendgrid: () => {
      return {
        dynamic_template_data: {
          name: 'John Doe'
        },
        template_id: 'SENDGRID_TEMPALTE_ID'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

When provider overrides conflict with the step response, the provider overrides will be used. For example, if a `subject` line is overriden on the provider level, Novu will ignore the `subject` line in the step response.

## Sending Email attachments

You can easily send attachments with the Novu API by passing the attachments array when triggering an Email based workflow. Attachment file can either be in the `buffer` or `base64` format.

import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  payload: {
    attachments: [
      {
        file: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/data/novu.jpeg'),
        name: 'novu.jpeg',
        mime: 'image/jpeg',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Using different email integration

In Novu integration store, multiple email channel type provider integrations can be active at the same time. But only one provider integration can be primary at a time. This primary integration will be used as a provider to deliver the email by default. If you want to use a different active provider integration then you can use the `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field.

If there are 4 active email integrations with these identifiers:-

1. sendgrid-abcdef
2. sendgrid-ghijkl
3. brevo-abcdef
4. mailersend-abcdef

Here, if `sendgrid-abcdef` is primary integration and you want to use `brevo-abcdef` with this trigger then you can use `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field as below:-

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      integrationIdentifier: "brevo-abcdef"
    },
  },
});
```
